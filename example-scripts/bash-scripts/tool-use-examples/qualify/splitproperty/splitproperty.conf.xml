<%  ===== SplitProperty =====                                                                                         %>
<%  The purpose of this tool is to split data out of a predicate according to a predicate value which matches a given %>
<%     filter.                                                                                                        %>
<%  ===== Reason for Use =====                                                                                        %>
<%  When an ontology is changed and expanded, there are times, when the data may be in one predicate when two (or     %>
<%     more) are desired. The predicate is changed according to a positive match with the filter regex.               %>
<%                                                                                                                    %>
<%  ===== PARAMETERS =====                                                                                            %>

<%  wordiness - (optional) sets the lowest level of log messages to be displayed to the console.  The lower the log   %>
<%          level, the more detailed the messages.                                                                    %>

<%          <wordiness>OFF</wordiness> - Results in no messages being displayed.                                      %>
<%          <wordiness>ERROR</wordiness> - Results in only messages from the ERROR level to be displayed.             %>
<%              Error messages detail when the tool has experienced an error preventing it from completing its task   %>
<%          <wordiness>WARN</wordiness> - Results in only messages above and including WARN level messages            %>
<%              to be displayed. Match does not produce any WARN level messages.                                      %>
<%          <wordiness>INFO</wordiness> - (Default) Results in all messages above and including INFO level            %>
<%              messages to be displayed. INFO level messages detail when the tool has started and ended and when it  %>
<%              begins/ends a phase ('Finding matches' and 'Beginning Rename of matches') and how many matches have   %>
<%              been found.                                                                                           %>
<%          <wordiness>DEBUG</wordiness> - Results in all messages above and including DEBUG level messages           %>
<%              to be displayed. DEBUG level messages detail each matching input URI to its VIVO URI as they are      %>
<%              processed. Additionally, it will display stacktrace information if an error occurs.                   %>
<%          <wordiness>ALL</Param> or TRACE<wordiness> - Results in all messages above and including TRACE            %>
<%              level messages to be displayed, since trace is the lowest level it is the same as ALL in practice.    %>
<%              TRACE level messages details every matching set as it is processed in each phase along with SPARQL    %>
<%              queries and start and stop for their execution.                                                       %>
