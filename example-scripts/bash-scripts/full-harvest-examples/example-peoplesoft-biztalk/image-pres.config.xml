	Param: dDelete 

	This flag states whether or not image data should be deleted from the origin model when the transfer criteria are met. 
	NOTE: You can set dDelete true and dTransfer false, but then image data will be lost without storage. A warning is in place 
	to reflect this. The most common usage of these flags will be TRUE/TRUE.
