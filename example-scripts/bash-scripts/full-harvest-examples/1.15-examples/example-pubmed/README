You need to modify certains files to ingest data using this example.

Here are the files that need to be modified:

1. vivo.model.xml

check that the database information is configured correctly for your system.  By default, it will
connect to a database called vitrodb_test on localhost

2. run-pubmed.sh

set to the directory where the harvester was installed
HARVESTER_INSTALL_DIR
(Note: there may be other shell scripts which have a set HARVESTER_INSTALL_DIR which
will need to modified)

3. pubmedfetch.config.xml

change the search string (termSerch), email address, numRecords, and batchSize to suit your preferences

5. all the changenamespace-*.config.xml files

change the "newNamespace" value to the namespace of your VIVO instance

CAVEAT: After the ingest is complete you will need to log onto the vivo instance ro rebuild the index and recompute inferences.
