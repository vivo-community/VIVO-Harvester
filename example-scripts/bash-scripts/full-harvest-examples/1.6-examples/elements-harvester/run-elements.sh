# Perform an update
# The harvester maintains copies of previous harvests in order to perform the same harvest twice
#   but only add the new statements, while removing the old statements that are no longer
#   contained in the input data. This is done in several steps of finding the old statements,
#   then the new statements, and then applying them to the Vivo main model.

# Find Subtractions
# When making the previous harvest model agree with the current harvest, the statements that exist in
#	the previous harvest but not in the current harvest need to be identified for removal.

# Find Additions
# When making the previous harvest model agree with the current harvest, the statements that exist in
#	the current harvest but not in the previous harvest need to be identified for addition.

# Apply Subtractions to Previous model

# Apply Additions to Previous model

# Now that the changes have been applied to the previous harvest and the harvested data in vivo
#	agree with the previous harvest, the changes are now applied to the vivo model.
