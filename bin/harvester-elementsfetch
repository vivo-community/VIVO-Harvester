#update memory to match your hardware -- set both to be the same, in general the more memory the better, but too much can cause errors as well.

#Variable for optimizations to the Java virtual machine.
#-server                                                Run in server mode, which takes longer to start but runs faster
#-d64                                                   Use 64-bit JVM
#-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC                Use concurrent (low pause time) garbage collector
#-XX:+DisableExplicitGC                 Prevent direct calls to garbage collection in the code
#-XX:+UseAdaptiveGCBoundary             Allow young/old boundary to move
#-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500               Target maximum for garbage collection time
#-XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit                Limit the amount of time that Java will stay in Garbage Collection before throwing an out of memory exception
#-XX:SurvivorRatio=16                   Shrink eden slightly (Normal is 25)
