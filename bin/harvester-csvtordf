#update memory to match your hardware -- set both to be the same, in general the more memory the better, but too much can cause errors as well.
#8G-12G on large vivo's seems to work well
MIN_MEM=256m
MAX_MEM=2048m

#Variable for optimizations to the Java virtual machine.
#-server						Run in server mode, which takes longer to start but runs faster
#-d64							Use 64-bit JVM
#-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC		Use concurrent (low pause time) garbage collector	
#-XX:+DisableExplicitGC			Prevent direct calls to garbage collection in the code
#-XX:+UseAdaptiveGCBoundary		Allow young/old boundary to move
#-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500		Target maximum for garbage collection time
#-XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit		Limit the amount of time that Java will stay in Garbage Collection before throwing an out of memory exception
#-XX:SurvivorRatio=16			Shrink eden slightly (Normal is 25)
#-Xnoclassgc					Disable collection of class objects
#-XX:UseSSE=3					Use SSE3 Processor extensions
#-XX:ParallelGCThreads=3		Maximum number of Parallel garbage collection tasks
